- Hi, I’m Guru Prasaath pursuing my computer science engineering degree in Data science at SRM Institute of Technology.
- I’m interested in reading, coding and trying out new things that would enhance my logical reasoning and coding skills. Apart from that, I like to spend time watching movies, cricket and listening to music.
- I’m currently learning Python and C.
- You can reach me @ guruprasaath.dilli@gmail.com
